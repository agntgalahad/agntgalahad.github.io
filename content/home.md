Hello, I am Himanshu Patil.

I am a Computer Science student with a big passion for Robotics, Computer Vision and Machine Learning.\
Right now I am working at IIT Bombay under the guidance of Prof. Ganesh Ramakrishnan to develop Computer Vision algorithms for drones.

I’m gearing up for an MS in Robotics soon, but this site is where I share my projects, ideas, and whatever else I’m building.
