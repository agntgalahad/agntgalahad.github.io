## Hi, I'm Himanshu!!
Welcome to my personal website! I’m a Computer Science student with a focus on Robotics, Machine Learning, and Computer Vision.

Currently, I’m working at IIT Bombay under the guidance of Prof. Ganesh Ramakrishnan, Prof. Rohit Saluja and Prof. Jaideep Joshi, developing cutting-edge Computer Vision algorithms for drones. My fascination with flight and the ability to access previously unreachable areas drives my passion for drone technology and autonomous navigation using techniques like SLAM.

Combining my computer science background with hardware-driven applications led me to robotics, where I’m excited to solve real-world challenges and push the boundaries of innovation.

- 🌟 **Current Projects**: Swarm of drones for exploration of an unknown area.
- 🛠️ **Skills**: ROS2, Python, C, C++, JAVA, Ubuntu, PyTorch, TensorFlow
