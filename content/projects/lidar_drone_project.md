This project involves developing an autonomous drone equipped with a 2D LiDAR sensor (e.g., RPLiDAR) for real-time mapping and navigation. Using ROS2 Humble, the system integrates Computer Vision and Machine Learning to enhance obstacle detection, localization, and path planning. The 2D LiDAR enables the drone to perform 2D SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping), constructing a floor-level occupancy grid for navigation in indoor and structured environments. Additional onboard sensors, such as an IMU and a downward-facing camera, will assist in altitude estimation and stabilization. This project is designed to improve skills in robot perception, sensor fusion, and autonomous flight control, making it a valuable addition to research in aerial robotics.

The making of the project is still in progress. You can check the status in my blogs here [BLOG](/blogs)
