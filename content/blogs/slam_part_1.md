This blog covers the basics of SLAM. I will try to use simple language for the beginners as well as go over the mathematics for the more experienced readers.\
SLAM stands for Simultaneous Localization and Mapping. It has been and still is one of the unsolved problems in robotics.\
SLAM tries to answer the 2 main question for a robot:
1. Where am I ?
2. What does my surrounding look like ?
